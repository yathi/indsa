        			<p>Make at least 2 copies of the required documents and place each copy in your cabin bag and laptop bag.

					<ul>
						<li>Passport & VISA
</li>
						<li>Indian Driving License/International Driving Permit (if you have one).
</li>
<li>Air Ticket</li>

              <h3>Fill the Airport Pickup form</h4>
              <p class="text-justify">If you need to be picked up from the airport, please fill in the airport pick up form. You can find this form <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~indsa/airport_pickup.html">here</a>. The pickup service is run by volunteers in the Indian student community here in Edmonton. If there are any changes in your travel itinerary or plans, please do intimate us immediately so we can arrange accordingly and make it a smooth experience for everyone. If you require temporary accommodation please mention the same while filling the form. As you know, the accommodation is subject to availability. It is provided by volunteers in the student community agreeing to host students coming from India in their homes. We can only tell you around 10 days prior to your departure if temporary accommodation can be arranged for you. The duration of temporary accommodation, if provided, will be only for a maximum of 5 days. We urge you to be proactive and start looking for permanent housing from the day you land in Canada (if you can find housing from you home country, that's even better!) </p>
            </div>
            <div id="currency">
              <h3>Currency</h4>
              <p class="text-justify">Managing your finances is an interesting part of one's life away from home. Please remember that your initial expenses will be higher here than the expenses you may incur later on. Even if you are on an assistantship, it might take you some time before you receive your paychecks. Hence make it a point to bring around $1500 - $2000 to take care of your initial expenses in Canada. It is advisable to bring this in the form of Traveler’s checks and not carry more than $1000 in cash. Students also choose to go for FOREX (Foreign Exchange) Cards that are issued by banks, which can be used like debit cards. The drawback of these cards is that they have a daily limit on the withdrawal amount and a charge of $2 to $4 may be levied on every transaction. However, these cards are accepted everywhere and can be swiped just like a debit card. You can also have money transferred from India once you have set up your bank account. In this case, you need to bring only $1000 in cash initially. Setting up a bank account is hassle free and we will discuss more about this in the banking section. This initial amount that you bring will help you during your transition and will cover the initial expenses like initial deposit while renting an apartment, first month&#39;s rent, setting up your apartment, buying a phone connection, purchasing a laptop in case you choose to buy one here, winter clothing etc.
After coming here, you can deposit your money in a suitable bank. For more information on banking, please see the section <a href="#bankaccount">Opening a bank account</a>.</p>

            <div id="carry">
              <h3>Things to carry from India</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">Please see the section “Check-list” to see a suggested list of basic things you should bring from India. The list is only for a basic idea and neither exhaustive nor comprehensive.  There are Indian grocery stores in Edmonton where you can get almost everything that you get in India. Please do not load your suitcases with spices and basic food items, since they are readily available here.</p>

            <div id="luggage">
              <h3>Luggage</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">In most cases airline rules allow only 2 pieces of check-in luggage of specified weight (usually 50 lbs/ 23 kg), 1 cabin luggage and 1 personal item( mostly laptop bag/ hand bag), all of specific dimensions. Some airlines allow 3 check-in bags for first-time students alone. Please check with your particular airline to confirm the same. Make sure you do not carry extra baggage and run into trouble. You might be asked to pay extra for that. Also be sure to stick name tags and contact information on either side of the baggage. This is to identify your baggage easily when you collect them.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="carryhand">
              <h3>Things to carry in hand</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">At all times, please remember to carry your passport with you. Do not keep them in the pockets in front of your seats in the flight or leave it unattended while visiting the restroom. Carry a few dollars to buy refreshments or make calls while in transit.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Passport and Admission letter.</li>
                <li>At least two sets of clothing.
</li>
<li>Telephone / Address book.
</li>
<li>Cash / Traveler's checks.</li>
<li>Medication for air sickness if you need it.
</li>
<li>Phone numbers of friends and/or relatives in Canada in case you need to contact them.
</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="flight">
              <h3>Flight</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">Please be present at the departing airport at least 3 hours prior to departure, since it is your first time. Once you finish checking in your luggage, enquire with the desk for immigration forms. They are also available at the immigration counters. Fill them up and proceed towards immigration. Clear immigration and security check and proceed towards your gate. Make sure that while in transit, you have lay-over periods of at least two hours to be on the safer side. Once you land in Canada, you have to clear customs to legally enter Canada. Please check the section “Immigration & Customs” for further information. If you will be continuing your journey by air, check in at the appropriate airline counter as soon as you are through with customs. Before you land, please make sure to adjust your watch to reflect the local time.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">In case your baggage does not arrive on the same flight as you do, do not waste too much time hunting for it. Mention it to the airline representative and give them a forwarding address with phone number where you can be reached. In any event, do not miss your connecting flight. In case your flight came in late or the onward flight is cancelled, it is the responsibility of the airline in which you flew into the country or the airline that cancelled its flight to make arrangements for another flight. If the delay involves an overnight stay, then the airline has to put you up for the night and also pay for your meals. Do not let the airline representative convince you otherwise.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Important Note: Please don't panic if it so happens that your flight arrives late and the time for the connecting flight is too near (say, within the next 10-15 minutes) for you to make it due to Immigration and Customs delays. Simply follow the same actions outlined above and get your airline to arrange things for you. Don't be rude, but be firm while dealing with the airline representatives.  </p>
            </div>

            <div id="customs">
              <h3>Immigration and Customs</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">You will have to go through customs and immigration at your port of entry, i.e. the first Canadian city where your aircraft lands. Before the plane lands, the flight attendant will distribute customs declaration forms and immigration forms (you should keep your passport with you at all times - do not put any of your immigration papers in your check-in luggage). Fill these out on the plane. You will submit them to the appropriate Canadian Customs authorities after you land. If you do not understand a form, ask the flight attendant for assistance. In most cases, before you land, a video detailing how to clear customs may be screened on the on-screen entertainment system of your aircraft. Penalties for concealing declarable items can be severe, so be honest and make a full declaration. As far as edibles go, just remember that there should be no fruits, vegetables or anything raw. Pickles, Spices, etc will be allowed in as long as they are packed properly and sealed. Spices are usually classified as non-perishable and dehydrated and you may declare them as such.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="airport_pickup">
              <h3>Airport Pickup</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">Once you reach Edmonton, please collect your baggage and proceed to Tim Hortons which is located in the airport right next to the baggage conveyor belts. If you are not able to find this place, proceed to the Information booth and ask them for directions to Tim Hortons. Tim Hortons is a popular chain of coffee shops in Canada. You are requested to wait here while one of our executives pick you up from here. While waiting you can enjoy a cup of coffee or hot chocolate from here. Edmonton International Airport has free Wifi. You should be able to connect to the Wifi network unless there are some technical difficulties.</p>

          <div id="bankaccount">
            <h3>Bank Account</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Opening a bank account is a relatively easy process. You need to carry your passport and study permit. It will be useful if you can carry your Indian driving license and/or your one card. If you do not have a local address, you can provide the address of your friend/classmate/executive temporarily and once you get an accommodation, you can update your changed address. Building a good credit history is very important if you are looking to settle down in Canada. ATB (Alberta Treasury Branches) a reputed financial institution, has provided a video outlining the importance of building a good credit history and showcasing the products designed especially for students ATB is also providing special offers for students who decide to bank with them. <a href="http://youtu.be/E-PBOFrprrA">Click here</a> to view this informative video.</p>

          <div id="healthcard">
            <h3>Alberta Health Card</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">If you are on a student visa, you are eligible to apply for an Alberta health card. This may cover the health services that are not covered under the University health plan. The University health plan is included in your tuition fee. You can apply for this at the local registry.

          <div id="albertaid">
            <h3>Alberta ID</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">If you have accommodation ready in Edmonton, it will be useful to apply for this piece of identification. This is a government id and will be helpful in many places. You can apply for this in the local registry.</p>
          </div>

          <div id="phoneconnection">
            <h3>Phone Connection</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Majority of the students who come to Edmonton for the first time, opt to take a phone on contract. The major telecom companies that operate in Canada are Rogers, Telus, Bell, Koodo, Fido and Virgin. Applying for a postpaid connection requires you have a local address proof (copy of your lease agreement). If you do not have this, you can apply for a prepaid connection and later convert it to postpaid. You can also take a prepaid connection temporarily which you can discard after one month when you are ready for the postpaid. The UofA sets up fairs in the first week of September and many Telecom companies provide great offers for students during this time. </p>

        </div>

        <div id="climate">
          <h2>Climate and Clothing</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">Edmonton has a prairie-steppe type climate. This means it usually enjoys sunny weather, even in winter, and the majority of precipitation comes in summer. Edmonton enjoys a dry climate with little of the summer humidity that bothers many people in Ontario. Even in summer, Edmonton’s nights are rather cool. Edmonton endures very cold winters, with quite a long snow season. Snow depths of greater than 1 cm are seen on about 141 days each year in Edmonton compared with about 10 days each year in Vancouver, 35 days in Penticton, 65 days in Toronto, 88 days in Calgary, and 120 days in Ottawa.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Although it enjoys high sunshine hours, Edmonton’s weather is often changeable – it is also notoriously difficult to predict in detail from day to day. Temperatures vary from 30 degrees to -25 degrees Celsius. The summer is from June till August. Temperatures are around 25 degrees Celsius during that period. Edmonton gets about 450 millimeters of precipitation per year most of which falls during winter in the form of snow. During the winter temperatures are -10 degrees Celsius on average. The temperature can drop to as low as -40 degree Celsius.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Since you are arriving in August, try getting a light jacket according to your sensitivity to cold. You do not have to bring winter jackets from India as you can purchase these jackets from here before the winter. If required you can get a couple of thermals from India for the winters else you can get these here in Edmonton. Also, do get a set or two of formal clothes for job interviews, since suits are pretty expensive here compared to India. INDSA organizes festivals around the year. So if you would like to dress up accordingly, get traditional clothes.</p>
